						<h3>Amigo</h3>
						<p>Soham Chatterjee</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Amigo is an open-source data pre-processing and augmentation pipeline for Deep Learning workloads. It makes writing repetitive pre-processing, augmentation and data pipeline codes obsolete and at the same time reduces the bottlenecks that general data-pipelines have. Amigo means friend or sidekick and that is what it\u2019s job is: To handle the mundane data-preprocessing tasks (that ML engineers spend most time on), so that you can concentrate on the main task of training and improving your machine learning model.

						<h3>eMark Wireless Multimeter</h3>
						<p>Projjal Gupta</p>
					</header>
					<p>eMark Wireless Multimeter is a device which can measure voltage and current values, similar to a regular multimeter, but it is wireless. It is supposed to be cheap and accessible to all, and the voltage and current values, along with power and other values can be directly read/calculated by a handheld device (Mobile Phones/Tablet/Laptops). The heart of the system will be a microcontroller and the wireless connection can be created using bluetooth/wifi. This needs to be accurate, cheap and should have features which support its build costs and quality.</p>

						<h3>CollegeGyan Bot</h3>
						<p>Swastik Banerjee</p>
					</header>
					<p>
							This is an open-source chatbot built using Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda function.\n\nThis app has data scraped and collected from various sites about the various colleges of India(as of now), and interacts with the user to guide him/her through their college admission and application procedures according to their pursued stream in +2 school level and their subject interests.\n\n\nThings still needed to be updated as soon as possible:\n\n    Data needs to be scraped about each individual colleges showing in the suggestions under each degree as of now, i.e, their mode of admission(results of which entrance exams are accepted); info about starting date of admission,etc. (typing the name of the college by the user should be responded with details about the college and if possible user must be able set a reminder which makes the app send a notification to the user on the date of start of admission/application,etc.\n\n    If the user has already given an examination for a university, then the bot will be able to predict his/her chances of getting into the particular university based on the score using an ML algorithm.\n\n    Build an entire Android app of the same to launch it in the market.\n\nNote: Any other updates are always welcome

						<h3>Flyr</h3>
						<p>Rounak Datta</p>
					</header>
					<p>
							Flyr is yet another bike-sharing platform, built for learning, understanding and re-implementing the robust engineering of such highly available systems. 'Flyr' stupidly means an open-source commute project. The project team aims to write the microservices from scratch, implement bike-sharing algorithms, do a lot of scalability and security engineering. The final product will 'at least' be able to demonstrate bike-booking, bike-pricing and time-and-route-estimations.

							<h3>Brevis</h3>
							<p>Niladri Shekhar Dutt</p>
						</header>
						<p>
								Brevis (Latin word for short) News is a news summariser which can generate a summary of any news article (technically it will be able to generate a summary of any article but we'll model it to work better with news). This will be an open source competitor to Inshorts, news in 60 words.

							<h3>Green Sense</h3>
							<p>Arko Chatterjee</p>
						</header>
						<p>
								It is extremely difficult for the farmers to maintain huge plantations by themselves, hence our product \u201cGreen Sense\u201d provides one stop solution to farmers to ease their work in all most every aspects of farming.\nWhat our Project offers to the farmers:\n\n    Localized weather forecast and prediction system.\n    Real Time Soil Monitoring \u2013 pH, Humidity\n    Plant Health based on the Chlorophyll Content \u2013 using Spectroscopic Techniques\n    Market Forecast of various Crops\n    Smart Crop Management\n    Creating a repository of images of diseased plants for research purposes\n    Redundant network = 0 downtime\n

							<h3>Cone detection for driverless vehicle on race track using SSD-Mobilenet</h3>
							<p>Tenzin</p>
						</header>
						<p>
								This project is part of driverless project initiated by CamberRacing Team. Project that I am working on is an cone detection for driverless vehicle on race track using SSD-Mobilenet.\n\nSo i have been working on prototype with Raspberry pi installed and using donkey framework which has streering and throttle value prediction CNN model and i have successfully trained this basic model and achieved good performance in testing environment. After that I have planned to extend the feature of prototype to have object detection to detect cone and sementic segmantation to segment out the race track from surrounding to have region of interest, which will help in better prediction on steering angle and throttle value. So I have been working on SSD-Mobilenet for cone detection, since it is the most suitable for prototype running on Raspberry Pi. Still there are two things yet to complete, 1. Implementing image augmention and image transformation to increase the bounding box prediction accuracy. 2. Implementing mAP (mean Average Precision)

							<h3>Pewter</h3>
							<p>Souradeep Das</p>
						</header>
						<p>
								"Pewter is a platform which allows you to add a personalized message or video when sending money(ethers) on the Ethereum Blockchain. The main use case include attaching a gift card or a video message when gifting money to a loved one. The application will combine the user's message and money(ether) to form an ERC721 Non-Fungible Token and make it transferable . The project is intended to implement "PayPal's gift money with designer cards" for the Ethereum Ecosystem.
